    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of the design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ...). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis become near impossible since they require a great number of function evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as surrogate models, response surface models, *metamodels* or emulators, that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheaper to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist multiple ways to build an approximation of a function: Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Functions, Support Vector Regressions... \n",
    "In all these metamodels (or surrogate models), a fundamental assumption is that the quantity of interest $y(x)$ can be written $(y(x) = \\hat{y}(x) + \\epsilon)$, where the residuals $\\epsilon$ are independently and identically distributed normal random variables, so that fitting the model $\\hat{y}(x)$ is performed by minimizing a measure over $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a practical example, take a look to this airfoil optimization tool: [http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/webfoil](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/webfoil)\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been constructed by lot of offline computations and an excellent tool developed jointly by University of Michigan, Nasa, Onera and ISAE-SUPAERO called SMT: [https://github.com/SMTorg/SMT](https://github.com/SMTorg/SMT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors strongly encourage students to have a look to classical textbooks such as [1] (for the Machine learning community) or [2] (for the Aerospace engineering community).\n",

    "The main idea behind Kriging is that the 'errors' -or more accurately, the deviations from the base model- in the predicted values $\\hat{y}$, are not independent. Rather, we take the view that the errors are a systematic function of the locations of the samples.\n",

    "Given the input data $\\mathbf{y} = \\left[y_1,\\ldots,y_N\\right]$ and $\\mathbf{x} =  \\left[x_1,\\ldots,x_N\\right]$, and given a covariance kernel $k(x,x')$, a Gaussian Process regressor estimates the distribution of $y(x)$ as a Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)$ with: $\\mu = K_*(x)K^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$, $\\sigma(y)^2 = k(x,x) - K_*(x)K^{-1}K_*(x)^T$, where:\n",

    "The objective function is treated as a black-box function. A Bayesian strategy sees the objective as a random function and places a prior over it. The prior captures our beliefs about the behavior of the function. After gathering the function evaluations, which are treated as data, the prior is updated to form the posterior distribution over the objective function. The posterior distribution, in turn, is used to construct an acquisition function (often also referred to as infill sampling criterion) that determines what the next query point should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest bodies of work on Bayesian optimisation is [4,5]. Kushner used [Wiener processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#Wiener_process) (Brownian motion processes) for one-dimensional problems. Kushner’s decision model was based on maximizing the probability of improvement, and included a parameter that controlled the trade-off between ‘more global’ and ‘more local’ optimization, in the same spirit as the Exploration/Exploitation trade-off.\n",

    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, in the former Soviet Union, Mockus and colleagues developed a multidimensional Bayesian optimization method using linear combinations of Wiener fields, some of which was published in English in [3]. This paper also describes an acquisition function that is based on myopic expected improvement of the posterior, which has been widely adopted in Bayesian optimization as the Expected Improvement function.\n",

    "In 1998, Jones used Gaussian processes together with the expected improvement function to successfully perform derivative-free optimization and experimental design through an algorithm called  Efficient  Global  Optimization, or EGO [6].\n",

    "Let $F$ be an expensive black-box function to be minimized. We sample $F$ at the different locations  $X = \\{x_1, x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}$ yielding the responses $Y = \\{y_1, y_2,\\ldots,y_n\\}$. We build a Kriging model (also called Gaussian process) with a mean function $\\mu$ and a variance function $\\sigma^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to compute the criterion EI. To do this, let us write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{min} = \\min \\{y_1, y_2,\\ldots,y_n\\}.$$\n",

    "The Expected Improvement funtion (EI) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[I(x)] = E[\\max(f_{min}-Y, 0)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ is the random variable following the distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x), \\sigma^{2}(x))$.\n",
    "By rewriting the right-hand side of EI's expression as an integral, and applying some tedious integration by parts, one can express the expected improvement in closed form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E[I(x)] = (f_{min} - \\mu(x))\\Phi\\left(\\frac{f_{min} - \\mu(x)}{\\sigma(x)}\\right) + \\sigma(x) \\phi\\left(\\frac{f_{min} - \\mu(x)}{\\sigma(x)}\\right)\n",
    "\\label{eq:EI_simp}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ and $\\phi(\\cdot)$ are respectively the cumulative and probability density functions of $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We then test the response $y_{n+1}$ of our black-box function $F$ at $x_{n+1}$, rebuild the model taking into account the new information gained, and research the point of maximum expected improvement again.\n",
