The primary motivation behind Keras is that you should be able to experiment fast and go from idea to result as quickly as possible. Thus, Keras is perfect for training purposes and tutorials for beginners. Building networks in Keras feels easy and natural. It includes some of the latest state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizers (Adam, RMSProp), normalization (BatchNorm), and activation layers (PReLU, ELU, LeakyReLU). Although, Keras does not support multi-GPU environments for training a network in parallel.\n",

    "The main factor which makes deep learning so useful for computer vision is the use of convolutions. Convolutional networks exploit the fact that the data is actually an image in the learning while decreasing the number of weights in the network. To do this, they define **convolution filters** that brush across the image. Such a filter defines a so-called **feature map** that shares the weights of the filter. The result of applying a feature map on an image is a new image of lower resolution, where each pixel is the result of the convolution of the filter with a set of pixels from the input image, as illustrated on the figure below.\n",
