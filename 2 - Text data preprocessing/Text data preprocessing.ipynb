    "\"What is there to pre-process?\" you might ask. Well, actually, text data comes in a very noisy form that we, humans, have become accustomed to and filter out effortlessly to grasp the core meaning of the text. It has a lot of formatting (fonts, colors, typography...), punctuation, abbreviations, common words, grammatical rules, etc. that we might wish to discard before even starting the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some pre-processing steps that can be performed on text:\n",
    "1. loading the data, removing attachements, merging title and body;\n",
    "2. tokenizing - splitting the text into atomic \"words\";\n",
    "3. removal of stop-words - very common words;\n",
    "4. removal of non-words - punctuation, numbers, gibberish;\n",
    "3. lemmatization - merge together \"find\", \"finds\", \"finder\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal is to be able to represent a document as a mathematical object, e.g. a vector, that our machine learning black boxes can process."
