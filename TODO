- Add derivation of backprop slides to ANN
- correct backprop in ANN: make it clearer by better decomposition of reasoning, more drawings, first compute \nabla_\theta for the last layer and work my way back instead of the general formula, disambiguate i = component index and i = sample number.
- add folder with images

- include PyTorch introduction notebook in DL chapter
