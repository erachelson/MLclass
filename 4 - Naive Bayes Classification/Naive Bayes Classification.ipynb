    "- $\\mathbb{P}(H=1.81, W=59, F=21 | S=0)$: the likelihood of meeting somebody with the specified features, given that his/her sex is $S=0$.\n",

    "The likelihood, however, is a bit trickier. Can we directly estimate the **joint probability** of the 3 variables $(H,W,F)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, we can. We can assume that among male individuals, $(H,W,F)$ are distributed according to a multivariate Normal distribution, with mean $\\mu=(\\mu_H, \\mu_W, \\mu_F)$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. The trick is then to estimate $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact, estimating $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$ without further hypothesis would require quite a lot of data, especially because $\\Sigma$ captures the **correlation** between $H$, $W$ and $F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Sigma$ is a $3\\times 3$ matrix, so it involves 9 parameters to estimate, and we unfortunately only have 9 data points.\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}(H,W,F | S) = &\\mathbb{P}(H | S)\\\\\n",

    "& \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(F | S, H, W)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Those three probabilities are univariate probabilities, much easier to estimate. However, the first one is a function of $S$ only, the second one depends on $S$ and $H$ and the third one depends on $S$, $H$ and $W$. To get an accurate estimate of the third one, we would need samples of the distribution of $F$ in enough points in the space of $(S,H,W)$ to cover it reasonably. This would require a number of data points that is exponential in the number of variables. That's what is called the **curse of dimensionality**, which makes this estimation problem difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this concrete. Suppose we discretize $H$, $W$ and $F$ in 10 bins each and suppose we require 100 samples to get a correct estimate of $\\mathbb{P}(F | S, H, W)$ for any given value of $(F, S, H, W)$. Then we need $100\\cdot 10^3\\cdot 2$ samples to correctly estimate this probability for all possible values of $(F, S, H, W)$. More generally, if we had $n$ continuous features rather than just three, we would require a number of data points that is exponential in $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To circumvent this problem, we are going to make a very **naive** assumption (hence the name of the method). We are going to assume that the weight, the height and the foot size are totally independent variables, that is the probability that a person be 1.85m is the same whatever his/her weight and foot size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this hypothesis is very strong and clearly does not hold is most real-world cases. But we will assume it nonetheless. In this case, the likelihood estimation becomes:\n",
