    "The human brain processes information efficiently, can we design an artificial computing method that mimics it?<br>\n",

    "\n",

The elements of $x$ can indicate binary statements which are true or false, such as \"it's raining\" or \"I have an umbrella\". We will model the *activation* of a neuron as:\n",
    "$$f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 0 & \\textrm{if }w^T x+b\\leq 0 \\\\ 1 & \\textrm{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.=step\\left(w^Tx + b\\right),$$\n",

    "Let's assume $j$ is an output neuron. In this case, $z_j$ is the $j$th component of $f_\\theta(x)$, and we have:\n",

    "Consequently, for the neurons of the output layer:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\partial f_\\theta}{\\partial w_{ij}}(x) = \\sigma'(y_j) x_{ij}}.$$\n",

    "And hence, the update of the input weights $w_{ij}$ for output neuron $j$ (in the output layer) is:\n",

    "Note that, in the expression above, $y$ is the value associated to $x$ (not to be confused with pre-neuron value $y_j$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the neurons of the layer just preceding the output layer. Let's call $L_j$ the set of indices of the neurons that directly feed on neuron $j$'s output. $z_j$ corresponds to the $x_{jl}$ variable for these neurons and $y_l$ is the scalar input to neuron $l$. \n",

    "A bit unconvincing. We are going to focus on the classification case and will use the PyTorch API in the next part of this class, but this first example contains many warnings. Although appealing for their many good properties (trainable online, scalable to large datasets and dimensions, versatile), neural networks can be hard to tune and are prone to overfitting (or underfitting) if nothing is done to prevent it. Also, the current scikit-learn implementation is maybe not the most adapted tool for neural networks."
